# TrafficLightSimulator

Welcome to **TrafficLightSimulator** â€“ an Arduino project that simulates a traffic light system. This project is part of my 100-day challenge, and today is **Day 5/100**. I'm excited to share my progress with you!

## About TrafficLightSimulator

TrafficLightSimulator is designed to emulate a standard traffic light using an Arduino. The project consists of three main parts: `main.ino` which contains the code, `components.csv` which lists the components used, and `schema.pdf` which provides the schematic for the project.

## Project Structure

- **main.ino**: This file contains the Arduino code to run the traffic light simulation.
- **components.csv**: This file lists all the components used in the project.
- **schema.pdf**: This file contains the schematic diagram for setting up the hardware.

## Setup

To set up and run the TrafficLightSimulator, follow these steps:

1. **Download the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/TrafficLightSimulator.git
    cd TrafficLightSimulator
    ```

2. **Upload the code to your Arduino**:

    - Open `main.ino` in the Arduino IDE.
    - Connect your Arduino board to your computer.
    - Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE.
    - Click the upload button to transfer the code to the Arduino.

3. **Gather the components**:

    Refer to `components.csv` to gather all the necessary components for the project.

4. **Set up the hardware**:

    Use the schematic provided in `schema.pdf` to correctly connect all components to your Arduino.
